# DataBig

Class Project Outline
• Use synthetic data sets to explore spark capabilities and limitations
• Two components
• Spark application that processes a data set to find hidden ‘insight’
• A python or scala application that creates a data set with a hidden insight
• Mechanisms to ‘hide’ an insight
• Noise in the data, e.g. from measurement errors
• Irrelevant information mixed with revelant information
• Encoding, simple examples
• graph expressed as a series of individual transactions between bank customers
• Statistical distribution in text records
• Problem design requires using Spark facilities to produce solution
• ETL processing, noise reduction or filtering, non-linear relationships, ...
• Creativity in creating ‘obstacles’ and finding/combining Spark functionality to overcome them is evaluation criterion!
